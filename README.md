1.Discover Recipes: The approach for discovering recipes involves fetching data asynchronously from a recipe API or database. Recipes can be filtered by cuisine, dietary restrictions, ingredients, and more to help users find exactly what they need.

2.Get Recipe Instructions: Once a recipe is selected, the instructions are displayed in a step-by-step format. Using JavaScript, you can dynamically load these instructions to enhance the user experience, ensuring that each step is clear and easy to follow.

3.Get Videos: Recipe-related videos can be integrated using a video player or by embedding videos directly from sources like YouTube. These videos provide a visual guide, making it easier for users to follow along with the recipe.

4.Add to Favorites: Users can add their favorite recipes to a favorites list. This feature can be implemented by storing recipe IDs in local storage or a database, allowing users to easily access their saved recipes.

5.Remove from Favorites: When users decide to remove a recipe from their favorites list, the recipe ID is deleted from the storage array. This update reflects immediately in the UI, ensuring that the favorites list is always up to date.
